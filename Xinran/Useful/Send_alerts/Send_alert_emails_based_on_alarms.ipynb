    "This Jupyter notebook is run by a cron job every hour, and its purpose is to send alert emails based on alarms and user subscribing records. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE that currently this code only deal with packet loss!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works following such procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Get user subscribing data (well formatted) for the monitoring task Packet Loss (user site as source and/or destination) from Google Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Get the packet loss alarms for the past hour (call it NEW), and also for the past past hour (call it OLD) from Elasticsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) If an alarm is not in OLD, but in NEW, then it means a new problem appears, and we should send email to relevant users\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) If an alarm is in OLD, but not in NEW, then it means an old problem disappears, and we should send email to relevant users\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) If an alarm is in both OLD and NEW, then it is a problem known to users, so we do not send any email to users\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) There is a corner case within (5), which is any newly registered user will not receive email about an existing old problem\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) So we should send all the alarms in NEW (i.e. currently exist) to newly registered users (i.e. who registered exactly in the past hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "(8) There is another corner case, which is when a user updates settings and includes new sites or tasks, it is effectively a newly registered user for these newly added sites or tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "(9) At the same time, note that when a user updates settings, in Google Sheets the contents of the original record updates (instead of creating a new record) and the timestamp becomes the new time. \n",
    "\n",
    "(10) So, combining the above design and implementation, when a user updates settings, as we detect newly registered users only based on timestamp, we will regard this old user (with new settings) as a new user, so we will send all currently existing alarms to this user (despite the fact that this user should already know most of these alarms, assuming the setting update is minor), but this kind of possibly repeated alarms only happen one time everytime the user updates settings. So I think overall this scheme is reasonable. "
